description: Today, the concept of the supernatural detective has been extensively
  explored in media like film, television, and books. However, renowned writer of
  "weird" fiction Algernon Blackwood was one of the first to broach this idea with
  his highly original character, John Silence. Silence is a brilliant physician whose
  willingness to delve into the matters dealing with the occult and supernatural leads
  him on dozens of adventures. This mini-collection is a perfect introduction to the
  Silence stories.
